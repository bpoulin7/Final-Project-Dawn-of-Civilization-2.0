# Final Project Proposal

## Premise

This will be a successor to the same coding project worked on all semester: a Python text-based adventure game set in the Ancient Near East, with a few main changes. The scope of the map will be at least as much as previous iterations, potentially broader if feasible. Rather than a set start tile and victory tile, the player will be able select a starting location, and the game will end naturally after a certain amount of in-game time ("turns") if the player makes it that long. The player's goal will be to collect as much gold and "prestige" as possible, travelling around the map and finding loot, enemies, obstacles, and allies. Random events will also occur to help or hinder the player's progress. This will be a solo project.

## Must-Have

 - a pre-determined map loosely representative of the real world ca. 1500 BCE
   - consists of city tiles, desert tiles, mountain tiles, and sea tiles
   - cities belong to certain empires, whose allegiances are important
   - player gets to choose starting location
   - traversing mountains and deserts is impossible
   - scope at least from the Levant (W) to the Caucasus (N) to Persia (E) to Arabia (S)
 - loot chests to be found across the map
 - various types of items to be found as loot
   - at least weapons, protection, and healing (consumables)
 - enemies and allies to be encountered around the map
   - battles
 - two points systems:
   - gold, gained from loot and trade
   - prestige, gained from winning battles and random events
 - random events to help or hinder the player

## Nice-to-Have

 - map scope including some or all of Egypt, Anatolia, Bactria, and/or India
   - if the Mediterranean is included, maybe boat travel?
 - minimap updates with the player's location
 - dynamic environment:
   - empires sometimes form/break alliances/rivalries
   - cities sometimes change hands (perhaps when conquered by the player?)
   - empires' rulers sometimes change (basically just cosmetic)
 - trading mechanic

## Similar Programs

A quick search was unable to reveal any programs with a scope similar to this one, although there are countless text-based adventure games with similar code, including examples and work from this class.

## Target User

Intended for fans of ancient history, grand strategy games, and text-based adventure games.
